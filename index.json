In contrast to previous work, functional diffusion works on samples that are represented by functions with a continuous domain. Functional diffusion can be seen as an extension of classical diffusion models to an infinite-dimensional domain. Functional diffusion is very versatile as images, videos, audio, 3D shapes, deformations, \u001btc, can be handled by the same framework with minimal changes. In addition, functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work, we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture. We show generative results on complicated signed distance functions and deformation functions defined on 3D surfaces.","tags":[],"title":"Functional Diffusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Cao*","Chang Luo*","Biao Zhang","Matthias Niessner","Jiapeng Tang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1709325764,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709325764,"objectID":"0b015daca18c4d16554b757b49b95de7","permalink":"https://1zb.github.io/publication/motion2vecset/","publishdate":"2022-05-02T23:42:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/motion2vecset/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce Motion2VecSets, a 4D diffusion model for dynamic surface reconstruction from point cloud sequences. While existing state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing non-rigid objects using neural field representations, conventional feed-forward networks encounter challenges with ambiguous observations from noisy, partial, or sparse point clouds. To address these challenges, we introduce a diffusion model that explicitly learns the shape and motion distribution of non-rigid objects through an iterative denoising process of compressed latent representations. The diffusion-based prior enables more plausible and probabilistic reconstructions when handling ambiguous inputs. We parameterize 4D dynamics with latent vector sets instead of using a global latent. This novel 4D representation allows us to learn local surface shape and deformation patterns, leading to more accurate non-linear motion capture and significantly improving generalizability to unseen motions and identities. For more temporal-coherent object tracking, we synchronously denoise deformation latent sets and exchange information across multiple frames. To avoid the computational overhead, we design an interleaved space and time attention block to alternately aggregate deformation latents along spatial and temporal domains. Extensive comparisons against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our Motion2VecSets in 4D reconstruction from various imperfect observations, notably achieving a 19% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) compared to CaDex for reconstructing unseen individuals from sparse point clouds on the DeformingThings4D-Animals dataset.","tags":[],"title":"Motion2VecSets: 4D Latent Vector Set Diffusion for Non-rigid Shape Reconstruction and Tracking ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Zhang","Jiapeng Tang","Matthias Niessner","Peter Wonka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1683060164,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683060164,"objectID":"a372d20345c49ea99c5853313c1c17ce","permalink":"https://1zb.github.io/publication/3dshape2vecset/","publishdate":"2022-05-02T23:42:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/3dshape2vecset/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce 3DShape2VecSet, a novel shape representation for neural fields designed for generative diffusion models. Our shape representation can encode 3D shapes given as surface models or point clouds, and represents them as neural fields. The concept of neural fields has previously been combined with a global latent vector, a regular grid of latent vectors, or an irregular grid of latent vectors. Our new representation encodes neural fields on top of a set of vectors. We draw from multiple concepts, such as the radial basis function representation and the cross attention and self-attention function, to design a learnable representation that is especially suitable for processing with transformers. Our results show improved performance in 3D shape encoding and 3D shape generative modeling tasks. We demonstrate a wide variety of generative applications: unconditioned generation, category-conditioned generation, text-conditioned generation, point-cloud completion, and image-conditioned generation.","tags":[],"title":"3DShape2VecSet: A 3d shape representation for neural fields and generative diffusion models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Zhang","Matthias Niessner","Peter Wonka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1665607364,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665607364,"objectID":"b95d554b183aae8763437201ca8e085b","permalink":"https://1zb.github.io/publication/3dilg/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T23:42:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/3dilg/","section":"publication","summary":"We proposed a method for representing shapes as irregular latent grids.

Our method uses a graph structure to encode roof topology and enforces the roof validity by optimizing a simple but effective planarity metric we propose. This approach is significantly more efficient than using general purpose 3D modeling tools such as 3ds Max or SketchUp, and more powerful and expressive than specialized tools such as the straight skeleton. Our optimization-based formulation is also flexible and can accommodate different styles and user preferences for roof modeling. We showcase two applications. The first application is an interactive roof editing framework that can be used for roof design or roof reconstruction from aerial images. We highlight the efficiency and generality of our approach by constructing a mesh-image paired dataset consisting of 2539 roofs. Our second application is a generative model to synthesize new roof meshes from scratch. We use our novel dataset to combine machine learning and our roof optimization techniques, by using transformers and graph convolutional networks to model roof topology, and our roof optimization methods to enforce the planarity constraint.","tags":[],"title":"Intuitive and Efficient Roof Modeling for Reconstruction and Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Zhang","Peter Wonka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614976964,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614976964,"objectID":"5b9e0843f58f959fae944961662e82db","permalink":"https://1zb.github.io/publication/prob-embed/","publishdate":"2021-03-05T23:42:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/prob-embed/","section":"publication","summary":"Point cloud instance segmentation","tags":[],"title":"Point cloud instance segmentation using probabilistic embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Zhang","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
